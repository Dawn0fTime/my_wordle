# TODO: don't highlight duplicates
# From YouTube comment:
# you can easily just set a flag to true at the beginning of the attempt loop,
# and then set it to true in the one where we find it in the correct place.
# Then in the conditional where we check that it is in the word, but in the
# wrong place, we can also check if that flag is true. If it is false, then we
# can color it yellow otherwise we can leave it as normal text. Hope this makes
# sense, as I've implemented it and got it working
